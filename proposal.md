- **Proposed End Date:**

---

## 2. Project Selection & Motivation
Describe why you selected this project and why you are a good fit.

Include:
- Personal or professional motivation
- Alignment with career goals
- Relevant interests or prior exposure

---

## 3. Problem Statement
Clearly describe the problem, need, or opportunity this project addresses.

Answer:
- What problem exists?
- Who is affected?
- Why does this problem matter?

Limit to 1–2 focused paragraphs.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution Overview
Provide a high-level description of your proposed solution.

Include:
- What you intend to build, deploy, or configure
- Core features or capabilities
- Explicit exclusions (what the project will *not* include)

---

## 5. Technical Stack & Tools
List the technologies you expect to use.  Please note that this solution MUST live within the cpt.internal network and must be maintainable by future students.

- **Operating System(s):**
- **Programming Language(s):**
- **Frameworks / Libraries:**
- **Databases / Storage:**
- **Infrastructure (VMs, containers, etc.):**
- **Tools (Git, CI, monitoring, APIs, etc.):**

---

## 6. Prerequisite Knowledge & Skills
Assess your readiness for this project.

Include:
- Skills you already have
- Skills you need to learn
- Relevant coursework completed
- Prior projects or experience

Be honest—this section helps scope the project appropriately.

---

## 7. Project Scope & Deliverables
Define what success looks like.

Include:
- Minimum viable deliverable (MVP)
- Required outputs (application, scripts, documentation, etc.)
- Optional stretch goals (if time permits)

---

## 8. Milestones & Timeline
Provide a rough timeline broken into phases.

Example:
- Phase 1: Research & Design
- Phase 2: Core Implementation
- Phase 3: Testing & Refinement
- Phase 4: Documentation & Presentation

Dates do not need to be exact, but planning is required.

---

## 9. Risks, Constraints & Dependencies
Identify potential challenges.

Include:
- Technical risks
- Time constraints
- External dependencies (APIs, credentials, access)
- Mitigation strategies

---

## 10. Security, Ethics & Safety Considerations
Address any relevant concerns, such as:
- Authentication and authorization
- Data sensitivity
- Network exposure
- Logging, monitoring, or automation impact
- Ethical considerations

A brief assessment of all of these is required, even if it is "N/A".

---

## 11. Team Structure (If Applicable)
If working in a group, describe:
- Team roles
- Communication plan
- Conflict resolution approach
- Workload distribution

---

## 12. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer Plan
Explain how this project will be documented.  Please note that this should include documentation in the UVDesk knowledgebase at the very least.  Programming projects should include readme.md files. 

Include:
- README or user documentation
- Deployment or maintenance guides
- How another student or administrator could continue the project

---

## 13. Faculty/cpt.internal Resources Requested
List any required resources:
- VM access
- Network access
- Credentials or APIs
- Special permissions
- Hardware (if applicable)

Please be sure to consider any future tickets you may need to submit to complete this work as those will need to be generated and assigned to the appropriate groups as soon as feasibly possible once the project kicks off to ensure timely delivery.  I will step in to help where required but you will likely be working with students in other classes so please be cognizant of their time!

---

## 14. Acknowledgement of Expectations
By submitting this proposal, I acknowledge that:
- This is a self-directed technical project
- I am responsible for research and troubleshooting
- Evaluation will consider process, documentation, and professionalism
